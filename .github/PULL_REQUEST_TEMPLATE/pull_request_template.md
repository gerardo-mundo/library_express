## Background

[CVT-]

Description of what you were asked to do. Try to be as detailed as possible.
The idea is to give enough background to the reviewer to perform the code review.
A link to the ticket is welcomed too.

## Changes done

High-level description of what changes you introduced in this PR. Don't bother going into details as they can be seen in the code. Describe _what_ was done, not how or where.

## Pending to be done

What things you left out and why. Maybe you left testing out because the PR was too big already? Maybe you will be following up with a second part with validations? Are these going to be followed up in another ticket? Let your reviewers know!

## Notes

Any design decisions not obvious in the code. Did you have to go outside of our standard? If so, why?

Any diagram or extra info (such as example data or output) that contributes to understanding the problem
